# Arduino-ethanol-sensor
The code files for an ethanol sensor made using Arduino. If toggled ON, the sensor reads the quantity of the ethanol in the air and outputs the result as a voltage (analog) back to the Arduino. The Arduino then displays this voltage on an LCD display and sends it to a locally hosted database, using an Ethernet shield and a short PHP script.
